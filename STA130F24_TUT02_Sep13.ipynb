    "#### 1. **[5 of the 40 minutes]** Quickly execute the \"rule of 5\" and take 5 minutes to break into 5 new groups of about 5 students and assign the following 5 questions to the 5 groups (and note that this instruction uses fives 5's üòâ). Consider allowing students to preferentially select which group they join by calling for volunteers for each prompt, and feel free to use 5 minutes from the next (dicussion) sections doing so if you choose to (since this could be viewed as being a part of the \"discussion\").\n",
    "\n",
